# DungeonGameUnity
Sometimes known as Dungeon Cubed this is a WIP unity dungeon game with action and rougelike elements. The end goal is to make a fun, playable game that at least a small number of people can enjoy and that we can finish. We are probably aiming to release summer of 2017.

##Edits

Becareful with editing stuff because this is a Unity project and weird things happen. Don't just upload what you think you changed please. I work with the Github app and it automatically syncs with the file on my computer to figure out and commit changes. 

- Download File and put it in your unity workspace
- Go into unity and hit "open"

##Plot Ideas

1) The cube (our main character) has been living in a world  of spheres. Because he is a cube, he is socially outcast. Eventually, he screws something up (maybe breaks something important) and they banish him into a dungeon that nobody has ever came back from. He fights his way through a horde of slime and monsters (the game), eventually, when he kills a big boss slime, he realizes that the slimes were really cubes like him, and that the big boss was his father. 

2) Plot points are conveyed through dropped notes in the level.
