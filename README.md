##Plot Ideas
1)The cube (our main character) has been living in a world  of spheres. Because he is a cube, he is socially outcast. Eventually, he screws something up (maybe breaks something important) and they banish him into a dungeon that nobody has ever came back from. He fights his way through a horde of slime and monsters (the game), eventually, when he kills a big boss slime, he realizes that the slimes were really cubes like him, and that the big boss was his father.
