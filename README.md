# DungeonGameUnity
A WIP unity dungeon game

##Edits

Becareful with editing stuff because this is a Unity project and weird things happen. Don't just upload what you think you changed please. I work with the Github app and it automatically syncs with the file on my computer to figure out and commit changes. 

- Download File and put it in your unity workspace
- Go into unity and hit "open"
- Navagate and open the folder labeled 'Dungeon^3'
- Get editing!

##Things to Consider

Should all stats be upgraded, or only allow player to choose a few

 - [ ] Autosave
 Save should clear on death
